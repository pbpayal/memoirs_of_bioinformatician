However, sequencing depth and RNA composition do need to be taken into account. To normalize for sequencing depth and RNA composition, DESeq2 uses the median of ratios method. On the user-end there is only one step, but on the back-end there are multiple steps involved, as described below. In Short: Take geometric mean of gene's counts across all samples Divide gene's counts in a sample by the geometric mean Take median of these ratios -&gt; sample's normalization factor (applied to gene counts) In Details: Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3 Gene 1 0 10 4 Gene 2 2 6 12 Gene 3 33 55 200 Step 1: Log of raw base counts Log with base e Step 2: Average of the logs for each gene in each sample Step 3: Filters genes with 0 counst in more than one sample Step 4: Subtract log(raw counts) -log(average) for eacg gene This is a ratio essentially of each gene across all samples Step 5: Calculate the median for each gene This helps to remove extreme gene expression like genes with high expression influencing genes with low expression. Thus focusing on genes with median expression and houskeeping genes Step 6: Convert median to normal values which is the scaling factor e^median = Normal Step 7: Divide original read counts by scaling factor 3.2 Dispersion When comparinng gene expression levels between groups, it is important to account for within group variabilty It is diffcult to estimate within group variabilty. Solution - pool information across genes which are expessed at similar level from replicates. Assumes that genes of similar average expression strength have similar dispersion. Maximum Likelihood - Dispersion estimates Fits a curve to capture the dependance of these estimates on the average expression strength Shrinks genewise values towards the curve using an empirical Baryes approach 3.3 Generalized Linear Model Follows negative binomeal distribution 3.3.1 Why negative binomeal distribution for analysing RNAseq data Explained quite nicely here 3.3.2 Statistical Significance and Multiple testing correction Wald Test for significance Benjamini Hochenberg 3.4 References StatQuest: DESeq2, part 1, Library Normalization Differential expression analysis HCB training "],["what-to-do-with-significant-differentially-expressed-genelist.html", "Chapter 4 What to do with significant differentially expressed genelist? 4.1 Functional Enrichment Analysis 4.2 Pathways 4.3 Interaction Databases 4.4 Text Mining 4.5 Drug Interaction Database 4.6 RNA seq specific Databases 4.7 Data Share", " Chapter 4 What to do with significant differentially expressed genelist? 4.1 Functional Enrichment Analysis Name Description Link g:Profiler Performs functional enrichment analysis, also known as over-representation analysis (ORA) or gene set enrichment analysis,on input gene list.

Fig A reference cohort, in which there is no attempt to identify homologies between the genome sequences. (B) A genome graph, in which homologies are collapsed and included as alternate paths in the graph. Existing reference coordinate systems: Variant databases use the reference coordinate systems Gene and transcript annotations Genome browsers use linear tracks of genomic data, and graph visualizations 5.6 Potential Solution - Sequence graphs Sequences represented as walks in graph De Bruijn graphs – directed graphs Nodes are kmers Edges are bases between “to” and “from” node Alternative paths stand in for both structural and single variants But just directed graphs are not enough, as they donot express strandness – forward or reverse Hence bi-directed graphs or Sequence Graphs ! But again all inversions, reverse tandem duplications, and arbitrarily complex rearrangements cannot be represented in just bi-directed graph Thus Bi-edged graphs !! Edge labeled version of bidirected graphs Fig Four types of genome graphs, all constructed from the pair of sequences ATCCCCTA and ATGTCTA. (A) De Bruijn graph. (B) Directed acyclic graph. (C) Bidirected graph (a.k.a., sequence graph). (D) Biedged graph (a.k.a., biedged sequence graph). 5.6.1 Things to consider: The moment we move to sequence graphs defining a locus becomes a problem Graphs have multiple paths, which have complex relationships Allelism in graphs Repeatome Hierarchy Pangenome ordering 5.6.2 Allelism in graphs Sites described as motifs called superbubble or ultrabubble - Directed acyclic subgraphs - connects through 1 source node and 1 sink node * New variants - add Motifs * Nested and overlapping subgraphs in structural variants However - Not all variation nicely partitioned Fig Ultrabubble sites in a biedged sequence graph. Each arrow shows the terminal node of a site. The color of the arrows indicates the node pairing. Note that the ultrabubble denoted by the gray pair of arrows is nested within the ultrabubble denoted by the purple arrows. 5.6.3 Repeatome as Array Sequence Graphs Highly repetitive satellite arrays Centromeres Ribosome Subgraphs of instances of type of repeat Similar instances of repeat were combined within graph node Fig A schematic example of an “Array Sequence Graph” of the type used to construct a linearization of the DXZ1 repeat array in the X Chromosome centromere. A collection of reads (top) shown in the context of a consensus higher-order repeat are converted into a graph representation (bottom). A cycle around the graph represents a higher-order repeat, and the individual repeat units (oblongs) are represented within each node (circles). Edges between individual repeat units represent phasing information from input reads. Transitions between nodes are annotated with probabilities. (Adapted from Miga et al. 2014) 5.6.4 Hierarchy Hierarchy of graphs In most collapsed graphs Repetitive elements are completely collapsed Input sequences are least collapsed Monoallelic representation of genome - Intermediates Mapping a subsequence to an element in more collapsed graphs in hierarchy automatically implies the mapping of the subsequence to all the more collapsed version of the element. Eg: mapping of repeat instance would imply mapping to the canonical copy, classifying it as an instance of the repeat type.

The solid and dotted edges indicate the adjacencies between nodes in the two source genomes.
